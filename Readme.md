Startover is a highly opponiated boilerplate for developing static websites on your Mac using HTML5, Sass, Gulp and Pow. With Startover you don't have to start over!

## Another boilerplate?

I agree! We really don't need more boilerplates or frameworks for developing websites. Startover relies heavily on the works of others like [html5boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/). However none of the boilerplates I've stumpled upon have been right for me. **Startover is not for everyone**. I created Startover to fit my workflow with the tools I like to use when developing websites. Starover can be used either as it is or as an inspiration for your development workflow.

A few disclaimeres:

* Startover is based on my workflow and how I work with static site development. I don't expect the code to be usable for anyone else but if you can use it that makes me happy!
* The code in this repository is mostly not documented. That means if you have no idea what some of the code do or just have a question, then just open up a new issue and I will try to respond.
* I use a mac for development therefore some of the code in this repository will assume the same.

## Startover in the wild

Here are some sites that was built with Startover:

* [robo.cat](http://robo.cat/) ([Source](http://github.com/robocat/robo.cat))
* [itsbreaking.com](http://itsbreaking.com/) ([Source](http://github.com/robocat/itsbreaking.com))
* [thermodo.com](http://thermodo.com/) ([Source](http://github.com/robocat/thermodo.com))
* [televisedapp.com](http://televisedapp.com/) ([Source](http://github.com/robocat/televisedapp.com))
* [designdk.co](http://designdk.co/) ([Source](http://github.com/ksmandersen/designdk))
* [cphfront.com](http://cphfront.com) ([Source](http://github.com/ksmandersen/cphfront.com))

If you're using Startover you should totally tell me so you can get featured here on this list of awesome sites (self-five).
